Robots are becoming increasingly common in modern society. Most of
these robots take the form of factory workers and cruise missiles, but
robots will soon be commonplace in many other contexts. Today's newest
robots vacuum our floors, drive us around, perform surgery, and assist
with science. In space. Tomorrow's robots will run errands, make art,
and help treat autism.

With this exciting new territory comes challenging new problems. 
If robots become truly commonplace, we must make ensure that such
robots behave *naturally* and *ethically*. These challenging questions
are being investigated by scientists in the field of Human-Robot
Interaction (or HRI), a relatively new field at the intersection of
computer science, psychology, and philosophy. 

In a series of blog posts, I'd like to discuss some of the big topics
in HRI. As I add new posts in the series, I will link to them on this
page. I expect the layout of the series will vaguely follow this
structure: 

* Section 1: Introduction to HRI
    * Robots and Agents
    * What is HRI?
* Section 2: Natural Interaction: What factors must be considered in making a robot natural to interact with?
    * Natural Communication
       * [Indirect Speech Act Understanding](http://williamstome.github.io//could-you-maybe-possibly-explain-indirect-speech-acts/)
    * Natural Behavior
    * Natural Appearance
* Section 3: Ethical Considerations: What factors must be considered in ensuring the ethical behavior and usage of a robot?
    * [Robot on the battlefield](http://williamstome.github.io//should-fully-autonomous-weapons-systems-be-banned/)
    * Robot in the bedroom
    * Robots at work
    * Home, Hospital, and School
