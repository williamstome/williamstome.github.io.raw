Why do students think computer science is about computers? Due
to the scarcity of K-12 computer science education, many students&rsquo;
ideas about computer science are grounded only in what they&rsquo;ve seen in
popular culture, leading to a wide array of misconceptions. Contrary
to popular belief, computer security is not principally concerned with
defending against hackers 
rapidly typing inscrutable symbols. Artificial intelligence is not
principally concerned with creating anthropomorphic robots who, if they
cannot love, can at least pass the Turing test. 


As an educator, I seek to strip away these preconceptions, and
to show students that while computer science may be more mundane
than its Hollywood depiction, it is even more wondrous and
exciting, because it teaches a new way to think.

Unfortunately, many computer science classes fall victim to the mode
of thinking criticized by Fellows & Parberry in the quote above. These
classes proceed 
linearly through the chosen course material, presenting each algorithm
or technique as an isolated tool to be added to the student's toolbox.


In contrast, my goal is for students to be able to look at any
problem they encounter in the world like the Necker cube shown
below. Students should see how a problem can, like the cube, be viewed in
different ways through a shift in perspective, and should understand
the relationships between those perspectives.

To foster this way of thinking, I require students to reflect deeply
on course material through both expository and persuasive writing.
This reflects my belief that development of writing skills is crucial
for computer science students.
While some tout the ability to break down problems computationally as the
"new literacy," students will need to master &ldquo;traditional literacy&rdquo;
regardless of whether they go on to become researchers, educators,
programmers, or elect not to continue in computer science at all. 

In addition to encouraging deep reflection through structured writing,
I also strive to promote student understanding by providing concrete
groundings to theoretical concepts whenever possible. In the classroom
this is effected through exercises which demystify
concepts by showing them to be straightforward and intuitive. For
example, in the Artificial 
Intelligence course I co-designed and co-taught, students 
learned about Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) by designing crossword
puzzles and then analyzing the strategies they used in that
process. Students learned about approximate inference by playing a novel
take on Clue which simulated Gibbs sampling. Outside the
classroom, I try to design programming assignments which provide
concrete computational groundings without burdening students with
busywork, i.e., coding for coding&rsquo;s sake. For example, after the
in-class crossword puzzle exercise, students were asked to to implement
CSP heuristics to improve the performance of an automatic crossword
creator. 

In designing both programming assignments and in-class exercisese, I
try to find ways to apply 
course material to domains beyond the sciences. Skills such as
computational modeling are becoming important in suprisingly diverse areas, from
literary analysis and sociology to history and
archaeology. Emphasizing the power which both computational thinking
and computational techniques can bring to these areas, a movement
known as the &ldquo;Digital Humanities,&rdquo; not only serves to expand the
horizons of students in STEM fields but also to hook the interest of
students of other backgrounds. Diversity in the classroom is an asset
which can be exploited to help students discover other ways to view
the Necker cubes of their academic and personal lives.

Finally, central to my teaching philosophy is the belief that learning
starts in the classroom but does not end there. 
I seek to make students aware of research opportunities where
they can further investigate the material they&rsquo;ve learned in class,
and encourage them to view their classmates not only as study-buddies
but as potential teammates for collaboration outside the classroom.
I would not be where I am today were it not for the four summers of
research I was lucky to take part in as an undergraduate at Hamilton
College, and during my time as a Masters and PhD student at Tufts I
had the good fortune to mentor many undergraduate research assistants,
some of whom have gone on to graduate school themselves. I find the
process of mentoring students to be exciting; undergraduate research
is not about recruiting students to serve as research tools, but
rather how we can share the world of research with our students, and
when we do, what we can discover together.
