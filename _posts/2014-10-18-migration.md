This posts marks the first in my migration from [theaigeek.wordpress.com](theaigeek.wordpress.com) to [williamstome.github.io](williamstome.github.io). I've chosen to migrate for several reasons.

### Flexibility ###
In wordpress, I had to use the wordpress.com dashboard for everything, which was a bit of a pain. By hosting on github pages and using jekyll, I can treat my blog like any other repository. I will also be able to use whatever theme I want, and edit it to my heart's content.

### Github Presence ###
As a computer scientist, hosting on github simply feels more appropriate than hosting on wordpress. I also do not yet have any open-source projects*, so this will give me a good chance to build up my github presence in the meantime.

### Refocus ###
Migrating to github gives me the excuse and the motivation to refocus my blog, only migrating over science-oriented posts, and leaving the book and movie reviews behind.  
The title of my old blog was also ambiguous. Was it The AI Geek? Books, Beer and Bots? Tales of the AI Geek? By migrating, I'm throwing away the title and directly associating the blog with myself.

### Moving Forward ###
Here's what to expect from this blog moving forward. My mission statement, if you will.  
I aim to provide:

* ADE Tutorials
* ADE Best Practices
* Opinion pieces on cognitive science and AI Robotics
* Research summaries of my published work, in lay terms
* Novel research on pet projects

*<sub>Our lab has the best inentions to push a release of our software into the wild, but given the size of our codebase that's not likely to happen anytime soon.</sub>
