My sister recently tweeted a link to an article entitled [Is There A Place For The Mind In Physics](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2013/01/29/169896128/is-there-a-place-for-the-mind-in-physics-part-i?sc=tw&amp;cc=share" target="_blank">"Is There A Place For The Mind In Physics)

I largely agree with the reviewer, but
am quite incredulous towards some of the reviewed author's
notions. Thanks for the read, sis!

>   Nagel brings both intellectual heft and clarity to this
    question. Nagel's famous 1974 article [What is it like to be a
    bat?](http://organizations.utep.edu/portals/1475/nagel_bat.pdf) is
    a masterpiece of argument against the reductionist view that Mind
    is nothing more than an [epiphenomena]
    (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/epiphenomena) (word
    of the day!) of neural activity. Instead, Nagel argued that there
    is vividness to the internal experience of consciousness that
    cannot be reduced to an external account of matter and motion
    (i.e., neurons and electrical currents).

In this paper, Nagel says that it is not worth developing a physical
theory of mind until we determine whether it is even possible to
describe the activity of the mind in objective terms. Is it meaningful
to describe what it's *really* like to be human? He uses this as an
argument against reducing consciousness to an objective level. Nagel
seems to be saying that there is something simply *indescribable*
about consciousness. Maybe it's the forty years that have passed since
the publication of this paper, but this seems like the lazy man's
approach. Arguing that consciousness is indescribable seems like a cop
out that does not try to address the question at hand. Additionally, I
would say that Nagel is asking the wrong question. He seems to be
saying that an objective view of consciousness has to be viewing
consciousness as how it "really feels" to be human in objective
terms. I'd argue that one cannot describe how it "really feels" to be
a computer adding numbers ad infinitum, but this in itself doesn't
prevent computers from becoming sentient (I'm not immediately
dismissing other arguments against cybersentience, just this
one). Similarly one can't describe how it really feels to "be the
brain" shooting current and chemicals around, but this doesn't prevent
us from being sentient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding Nagel's point in
the article, but I was entirely unconvinced. 

Let's get back to the NPRticle.
It sounds like Nagel's Easy/Hard problem distinction falls into the same trap.
Nagel is saying that the neurons firing and sensory experiences are
essentially different things, and this prevents studying the former
from revealing the true nature of the latter. 
Nagel is once again falling back on the "indescribability" factor of
consciousness, which is a crutch. To go back to the computer analogy
of the mind... the physical bit arithmatic in a computer and the high
level functionality of its software are essentially different beasts,
but this doesn't mean that they aren't directly related. Indeed,
although they're completely different in nature, they are deeply
causally related.

The article then summarizes Nagel as follows:

>   Now, given that I'm a physicist, you might expect me to slam
    Nagel for being hopelessly lost in the weeds. The truth is, while I
    deeply suspect he is wrong, I do find his perspective bracing. Given
    his atheism, the question Nagel is really asking is stunning: Is there
    a fundamental place for the Mind in the fabric of reality? In its
    crudest form the question could be phrased: Might there be some
    "thing" we need to add to our picture of reality that we don't have
    now in order to embrace mind?

I'm a little incredulous towards this position (a little more so than
the article's author, even). 
Do you really think that there's some unknown substance in the
universe which is needed to understand how the mind works? Just
because we haven't yet discovered how all behavior in the mind is
produced by the activation patterns in the brain doesn't mean that we
need to give up, as Nagel suggests, and wait until we discover some
wonder tissue that ties everything together.
