Today was my last lecture in the "Philosophical Foundations of Cognitive Science"
class I took this semester with Dan Dennett. 

In class, Dennett posited the following frame theory (to the best of
my recollection): The mind, in a highly parallel fashion, is
constantly evaluating a multitude of stories (i.e., frames) to
determine which frame or combination of frames is most likely to
generalize to the current context, thus determining what one's
response should be in its current scenario. 

I pointed out that this would likely run into similar problems to
Skinner's radical behaviorism; Skinner believed that behaviors were
generated in a stringent stimulus-response framework, and that any
observed behavior was thus the result of some reinforcement in the
agent's past. If an agent was presented with a novel (i.e., never
before experienced) stimulus, Skinner believed that the agent's
response was the result of reinforcement to *similar* responses to
*similar* stimuli. 

Unfortunately, Skinner is *begging the question*, as any possible
behavior is explained in the same manner: Skinner has only to say
"It's reinforcement!" and be done with it. This  merely *explains
away* the question. I'm sure Karl Popper would be equally unconvinced
with this, as the approaches of Skinner and Dennett seem, at least at
first inspection, to be unfalsifiable.
 
Or are they?

Could one concoct a scenario to which there is no sufficiently similar
scenario experienced or heard of by the agent for which it to compare
to, meaning the agent would have no way of selecting any appropriate
behavior, as in Dennett's case it would not find any appropriate frame
with sufficient activation, and in Skinner's case would not find any
sufficiently reinforced response to execute? 

This brings us to the third actor in our scene: H. P. Lovecraft.

In Lovecraft's stories, characters encounter indescribable horrors,
and go insane as a result. Viewed through the lens of Dennett's
theory, my intuition would be that as the beasts are inherently
indescribable, they could not possibly have been described in a
story. Viewed through the lens of Skinner's theory, the indescribable
aspect would similarly entail the lack of any sufficiently similar
scenario with which to compare the encounter with. 

As no frame or response would be choosable by the agent, they would
have no way of responding to the encounter. In the world of
H. P. Lovecraft, this would result in a rending of the poor soul's
mind, rendering them insane. 

Of course, one is unable to put this mapping to the test, as (to my
knowledge) there are no indescribable horrors lurking about for us to
present to subjects, and even if there were, the IRB for the
experiment would be a tough sell.
