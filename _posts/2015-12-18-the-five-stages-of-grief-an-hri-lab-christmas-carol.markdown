**Warning: Less than Serious Material Ahead**  
<br/>
Happy Holidays!  
<br/>
This year has marked large changes in the HRI Lab: this semester, our
lab lost one member (to graduation! good for him, sad for us) and
gained **eight**. Six new grad students started this semester, one
more just joined and will be starting next month, and we acquired a new
staff programmer.  
<br/>
Anyone who knows me well knows that I love to sing. It should thus be
no surprise that I was thrilled to learn that two of my new labmates
sing! I was even able to recruit one of them to join my a cappella
group, [Out of Range](https://www.facebook.com/OutofRangeACappella/).
<br/>
For our lab holiday party, my advisor decided that the lab band
(BA$H!, comprised of my advisor on bass and keyboard, our lab manager
on drums, our postdoc on guitar, and myself on vocals) would perform a
few songs. So, I figured, as long as I was singing, there might as
well be some a cappella action thrown in too!  
<br/>
I thus put together an a cappella arrangement of holiday carols for my
two new singing labmates and I,
themed around an obviously fictitious scenario in which our lab has to
pull together a demo for a funding agency and things go horribly
wrong.  
<br/>
Enjoy!  

## The Five Stages of Grief: An HRI Lab Christmas Carol ##  
*Scene: It’s Sunday night, and the grad students are busy at work in
the lab. A demo of the HRI Lab’s new “Carol Singing Robot” needs to be
given in the morning, but the robots have mysteriously stopped
working*  
  
### 8:00 PM - Denial ###  
*Tune: Silent Night*  
<br/>
Silent Nao, Soundless Nao  
Working any second now  
Nothing's changed here, no code's been revised  
Why'd you stop when Matthias arrived  
Nothing's changed in your code  
Nothing's changed in your code  
  
### 10:00 PM - Anger ###
*Tune: Santa Claus is Coming to Town*  
<br/>
You better not crash  
You better not die  
You better not break  
I'm telling you why  
<br/>
ONR is coming to lab  
<br/>
They've gotta be wowed  
They've gotta be stunned  
They're gonna decide  
Whose project to fund  
<br/>
ONR is coming to lab  
<br/>
These processes keep sleeping  
There must be some mistake  
You can't find java library?!  
JUST COMPILE FOR GOODNESS SAKE!  
<br/>
You better not crash  
You better not die  
You better not break  
I'm telling you why  
<br/>
ONR is coming to lab  
  
### 12:00 AM - Bargaining ###  
*Tune: It Came Upon a Midnight Clear*  
<br/>
I need to finish, it's midnight here  
Please help me fix all of these bugs (damn bugs!)  
I'll buy a case of your fav'rite beer  
I'll give you forty-six bucks (big bucks!)  
<br/>  
Peace on the earth, a Mercedes-Benz  
I'll promise you 'bout anything (more beer!)  
If you would just help me figure out  
How I can make this Nao sing  
  
### 2:00 AM - Depression ###  
*Tune: Oh Little Town of Bethlehem*  
<br/>
So little time to get this done  
My brain is getting fried  
I need to leave and go to sleep  
This isn't justified  
<br/>
Yet in the dark I'm working  
Until I get this right  
The jokes and jeers of all my peers  
are met in me tonight  
  
### 4:00 AM - Acceptance ###  
*Tune: White Christmas*  
<br/>
I'm dreaming of a live demo  
Just like the ones I used to watch  
No components failing  
No students swearing  
No robots driving into walls (Great Big Holes!)  
<br/>
Oh and I'm dreaming of a live demo  
With ev'ry action script I write  
But until my tests get green lights  
Let's not do our demo live tonight
