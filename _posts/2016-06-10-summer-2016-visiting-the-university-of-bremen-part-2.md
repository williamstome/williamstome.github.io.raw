For the past month, I've been visiting the Institute for Artificial
Intelligence (IAI) at the University of Bremen. At Tufts, I (along with most
other members of the HRI Lab) am enrolled in a joint Computer Science
-- Cognitive Science Ph.D. program, which has an extra-hefty course
load. This means that summers are typically our only time to 
buckle down and devote ourselves entirely to research -- and so this
has been my first opportunity to do graduate research outside of our
lab. 

### Working at the IAI ###
My primary projects involved integration of my natural language
understanding system with the IAI's aerial search-and-rescue simulation, and
more generally integrating our robot architecture with the intelligent
logging, reasoning, and visualization capabilities provided by their
KnowRob and OpenEase frameworks.

In addition to this, however, I've had a variety of projects competing for my attention:

* Preparing a 1/2-hour research seminar that I presented for the IAI while I was here, and preparing a 1-hour research seminar that I'll present at MITRE corporation when I return home.
* Preparing my job application package, which needs to be finalized when universities start advertising faculty positions in the fall. 
* Preparing and submitting a journal article. 
* Helping to organize the AAAI Fall Symposium on AI for HRI (AI-HRI 2016).
* Coordinating multiple experiments being conducted or analyzed back in Boston.

All told, I ended up working 12-15 hours a day, six days a week. It
was hard work, but it was also nice to dive so deeply into "focus
mode". Hopefully some interesting papers will come out of our collaboration,
at which point I'll be able to share more details of my work here. 

### DFKI and the Arithmeum  ###
While I was here, the Robotics Innovation Center of the DFKI (the
German Research Center for AI) had a rare open house -- which meant I
got to spend a morning checking out some incredible new
technology. Here are a few photos from that event.

Continuing on the topic of mechanical marvels, I had the opportunity
to visit the *Arithmeum* -- a fascinating museum in Bonn chronicling
the history of calculation. Here are a few of the gorgeous machines on
display there.

### Living in Germany ###

Since I was pretty much working all the time, daily life was pretty ordinary. 
To be honest, the largest deviations from my expectations came when I
had to purchase food. 

Purchasing groceries was... unpleasant. The closest grocery store
nearest to me was massively overcrowded, with only two registers, and
no baggers (perhaps because you're charged by-the-bag unless you're
using a reusable bag). I thus had to try to stuff food into my
backpack as quickly as it was being scanned so that I wouldn't cause a
holdup for the next person. This is in stark contrast to our
supermarket at home, with something like twenty registers. Half of
which are self-scan, meaning you need to bag things yourself, but it's
rare that you have more than a single person behind you in line, so
the rush to bag isn't quite as frenzied.  

My other option here for purchasing groceries was the mini-mart down
the street from my apartment. Once again, the unpleasantness here came
on the bagging front. My first night in Bremen I visited the minimart
to load up on essentials. At the register, the cashier asked if I'd
like a bag, and I responded that I was going to try to fit everything
in my backpack. When I ended up needing a bag for my last few items,
the cashier gave me a gloating look and said "So *now* you need a bag. We can think!" 

It wasn't all bad, of course. I originally intended to bring leftovers
for lunch, but this ended up being unnecessary. Pretty much all the
grad students in the lab ate at the university's dining hall, where
you could get a nice lunch for \$2.35. This was fairly jaw-dropping
given that at Tufts, if I don't bring my lunch, a burrito from the
grocery store next to our lab costs over \$8. I also attended a free
barbeque for international students, which was nice, although it felt
odd to be considered an "international student", due to my 27 years of
exposure to ethnocentric US norms. 

### There and Back Again ###
It's been a great month in Bremen, but I'm excited to go home! 
This is one Br-exit I can support.
