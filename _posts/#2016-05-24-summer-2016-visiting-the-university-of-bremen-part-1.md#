Auf Wiedersehen Amerika, Hallo Deutschland!

In just a few short days, I'll be travelling to Germany: land of
lager, locomotives, and lederhosen, if American television is to be
believed. 
#
Last year, our lab had the pleasure of hosting Fereshta Yazdani, a PhD
student working with Michael Beetz at the University of Bremen. Now, I
will be visiting their lab for one month, where I will work to
integrate my natural language understanding system with their
reasoning system. During my spare time, I'll have my hands full
writing papers, remotely supervising my undergraduate research
assistants, and helping to organize a workshop for the AAAI Fall
Symposium. 

Being productive shouldn't be too hard, given that my Linux laptop
can't run most games (e.g., Overwatch), and given that the best "beer
bar" in Bremen appears to only have two beers on tap*. This isn't to
say I plan to spend **all** my time in lab, of course! I'll be kicking
off my trip with a two-day visit to Amsterdam (it turns out it's
rather expensive to fly into Bremen directly), and I hope to take a
weekend at some point to visit elsewhere in Germany (Cologne, most likely).


*Everyone's first reaction to my travel announcement is to ask whether
 I'm excited for the beer in Germany. While I'm excited to live in a
 new city, in a country that has a rich brewing history, the simple
 truth is that the German beer scene is nowhere close to what we have
 here in the states.
